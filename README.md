# FinSight-Corp.Financial-Analysis-Report
This repository features an interactive financial analysis dashboard built using Power BI, based on a sample dataset provided within the Power BI desktop application. The report simulates real-world business insights for a fictional company named FinSight Corp., which I retained as the brand name to give the dashboard a professional and contextual identity.

📊 Dashboard Highlights
Key components of the dashboard include:

✅ Sales, Orders, Profits and Discounts YoY Comparison

🌍 Orders and Profits by Country

📦 Sales Amount by Product

 2. Slight Drop in Profit Margin
Although absolute profit increased, profit percentage decreased slightly from 14.7% to 14.1% (a -3.97% change), possibly due to higher discounts or operational costs.

Channel Partners segment is the most profitable (73.13% profit) across all product lines.
In contrast, Enterprise segment has a negative profit margin (-3.13%), suggesting underperformance or overspending.
